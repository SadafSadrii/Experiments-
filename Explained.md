So ... so far I have two vinyl pieces and a fabric piece. They are sandwitched together and the first vinyl is glued to the fabric (Ticky Glue doesn't work if you wanna do this)!
Then I cutted my pattern with cutter and scissor, which is not super clean, so laser is recommended.
The tip of pieces of each line is attached to a thread and the thread is attached to a 360 servo. ( Don't twist the thread over servo, only attach a small part of your thread and then knot it)
the code is the servo knob of Arduino Library.
